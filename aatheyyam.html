        Theyyam are Hindu ritualistic dance forms practiced in northern Kerala and some parts of Karnataka.Theyyam consists of traditions, rituals and customs associated with temples.The people of the region consider Theyyam itself as a channel to a god and they thus seek blessings from Theyyam.

        In Kasaragod and Kannur districts, this ritual art is mainly performed in the kavus (temples) or ancestral houses of Nambiar, Thiyyar, Vaniyar and Maniyani communities.There are about 456 types of Theyyams documented. Theyyam is mainly performed by males, except the Devakoothu theyyam; the Devakoothu is the only Theyyam ritual performed by women.Devakoothu is performed only in the Thekkumbad Kulom temple.

        In Kerala, Theyyam is performed predominantly in the North Malabar region (consisting of present-day Kasargod, Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode). A similar custom is followed in the Tulunadu region of neighbouring Karnataka known as Bhuta Kola.
        
        Theyyam season starts from the tenth day of the Malayalam month of Thulam (usually falls during October, and known as paththaam-udayam) and lasts up to seven months till the middle of Edavam month (typically around May end, June). The last Kaliyaattam for the season is performed at Madayi Kavu and Kalarivathukkal Bhagavathy Temple, Both being the family shrines of Kolathiri royal family.
