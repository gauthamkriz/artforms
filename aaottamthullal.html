        Ottamthullal is a recite-and-dance art-form of Kerala.The folksy performance,often laced with humour intended at criticism of society,is accompanied by a mridangam and/or the handy idakka besides a pair of cymbals.In Ottamthullal, a solo performer, with green makeup and a colourful costume (decorated with a long red and white band and painted wooden ornaments), acts and dances while reciting dance (Thullal) (lyrics).[4] A chorus or one or more artists repeats each sentence as it is completed. More recently, Ottamthullal has been performed with a solo female actor and with an ensemble cast.

        Nambiar parodies the ways of landlords and other prominent citizens, sometimes even the king. For example, the character of Bhima from the epic the Mahabharata is portrayed as an oaf. Higher castes including Brahmin are not spared.Ottan thullal is performed in Malayalam, which pleases local audiences. Old sayings and elements of folklore are used.There may be 64 or more Ottamthullal works. Examples include:

        Kallyana Sougandhikam (a rare flower), Bhima is searching for the flower and has a long conversation with his older brother, Hanuman.
        Kiratham, Garudagarva bhangam, Santhanagopalam, Ghoshayathra etc.
