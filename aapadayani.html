        Padayani is a traditional folk dance and a ritual art from the central portion of the Indian state of Kerala.A ceremonial dance involving masks,it is an ancient ritual performed in Bhagavati temples.

        The dance is performed in honor of Bhadrakaali. Meaning, a 'row of warriors', Padayani is an art form that blends all music, dance, theatre, satire, facial masks, and paintings. It is part of worship of Bhadrakali and is staged in temples dedicated to the goddess from mid-December to mid-May. Padayani is unique to central Travancore, comprising the Pathanamthitta and kottayam districts of Kerala.
